# Smart Code Comment Generator

## Project Title
Smart Code Comment Generator

## Brief Description
This project is an AI-powered tool designed to assist developers in writing clear and informative comments for their code. By leveraging AI technology, the tool aims to enhance code readability and understanding for both the original author and other developers.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: TBD (for code parsing)
- AI Model: GPT-2 (or similar)
- API: OpenAI, Cohere, AI21

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the necessary scripts for code parsing, AI model training, and comment generation.

## Usage Instructions
1. Provide your code snippets to the tool for comment generation.
2. Receive clear and concise natural language comments summarizing the purpose or behavior of the code sections.

## Challenges
Describing the semantics and complexities of code in a way that is both accurate and easily understandable.

## Example Use Cases
- Adding comments to a codebase after a period of disuse.
- Assisting new developers in understanding project code.
- Generating explanations for intricate functions or algorithms.

## Stretch Goals
- Context Awareness: Enhance comment generation by considering the surrounding code context.
- Code Quality Hints: Provide suggestions for code improvements or inefficiencies in addition to comments.

## Free-of-Cost Considerations
- Opt for a smaller language model to stay within free API usage tiers.
- Utilize open-source, well-commented code repositories for training data.
